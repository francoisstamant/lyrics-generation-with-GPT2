# lyrics-generation-with-GPT2

## Description
The following project aims at finetuning GPT-2 to a specific dataset in order to generate song lyrics. Indeed, training a pretrained model and a specific dataset can increase performance for a specific task.

# Files
GPT2_final.ipynb contains all the training and finetuning of the GPT-2 model. 

Lyrics_Dash_App.ipynb contains the code to create a web-based app with Dash, in order to automate lyrics generation. 

You DO need to have a model created and saved somewhere on your desktop before the app can be properly used!
